# Create React App

This is a custom template with only essential files for a **React App**, it uses [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
It is useful for quickly creating a new app without all the extra stuff that comes with the default Create React App template.

-   Created with React 18.2 in 2022.

_NOTE: Things may have been changed since then._

## RUN APP

    ```bash
    npm i
    npm start
    ```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
